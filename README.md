# Module 06: Weather Forecast [Using Web-server API]

## Project Objective

⋅⋅⋅ Utilise the data coming from an open-source API (https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api). During the process {as a "Rookie Developer"}, I notice there were multiple options you use to fetch data using the API link, for e.g. "by calling different parameter from the open-source API, or use the other links available to fetch the current/5daily forecast.
